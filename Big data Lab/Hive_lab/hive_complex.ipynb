    "### Step 1: Create a Table with Complex Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a Hive `CREATE TABLE` statement with complex data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employee_details (\n",
    "    id INT,\n",
    "    name STRING,\n",
    "    skills ARRAY<STRING>,\n",
    "    addresses MAP<STRING, STRING>,\n",
    "    job_info STRUCT<\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`skills`**: An array of strings representing the skills of an employee.\n",
    "- **`addresses`**: A map with key-value pairs where both keys and values are strings, representing different types of addresses (e.g., home, office).\n",
    "- **`job_info`**: A struct to store nested fields like job title, start date, and salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Prepare a Sample Data File\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a sample data file named `employee_details.txt` with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1,John Doe,Java|Python|SQL,home:New York|office:San Francisco,{job_title:'Engineer',start_date:'2022-01-10',salary:85000.0}\n",

    "   FROM employee_details;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Retrieve all data for employees with \"Python\" as one of their skills:**\n",
